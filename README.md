# matplotlibPyQt5

##Introduction

Embedding [matplotlib plot](http://matplotlib.org/) on PyQt GUI or some other python GUI library's is noting new when it comes to examples provided by various authors across the web and examples provided in [matplotlib documentation](http://matplotlib.org/examples/user_interfaces/index.html). But as you can see there is no example for embedding matplotlib plot in PyQt5. I wanted to make some small app for my android device and needed plot as part of my application. You can do this with [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide), and I encourage you to do so if you want to make commercial app, for me this was not the case, my app is for my own purpose and at some point I might switch from android to iOS device. Remember that PySide is not going to work on iOS devices while [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) will.

##Prerequisites

Like in previous python samples I will use Python 3. All things you need for this:

- Python 3
- [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)
- [Matplotlib 1.4.2](http://matplotlib.org/1.4.2/index.html)

I'm not sure but previous versions of matplolib don't support PyQt5.
